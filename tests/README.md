# E2E Testing vs. AC Testing

## Overview

This Markdown file provides a brief comparison between End-to-End (E2E) testing and Acceptance
Criteria (AC) testing in the context of software development.

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Definition:** E2E testing involves testing the entire application from start to finish to ensure
  all components work together.
- **Scope:** It covers multiple layers, including the UI, databases, and interactions between
  different modules or services.
- **Purpose:** The goal is to validate the application's functionality in real-world scenarios and
  catch integration issues.
- **Automation:** E2E tests are often automated, simulating user interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria (AC) Testing

- **Definition:** AC are specific conditions that a product or feature must satisfy to be accepted
  by users.
- **Scope:** It is defined at the user story or feature level, focusing on requirements for
  acceptance.
- **Purpose:** AC testing ensures delivered software aligns with stakeholder expectations and meets
  predefined criteria.
- **Automation:** While some aspects can be automated, AC testing often involves manual validation.

## Key Differences

- **Scope:** E2E testing is broader, covering the entire application, while AC testing focuses on
  specific feature acceptance criteria.
- **Automation:** E2E testing relies heavily on automation; AC testing involves both automated and
  manual testing.
- **Purpose:** E2E testing ensures seamless application integration, while AC testing validates
  features against predefined acceptance criteria.
